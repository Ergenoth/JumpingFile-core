# JumpingFile-core
JumpingFile is a open core document management system.\
The project aims to be a simple solution for private users or corporate use.\
\
For private users there is no open source document management system which can be simply installed on the machine of the user. Rather more for every open souce document management system, aimed for private users, needs to install a server in a docker environemtn or generally a server environment. But the default private user is not able to set up a server side component to use the doucment management system. Additionally the configuration of such a system is not easy and not the favourite task of private users. Therefore JumpingFile aims to keep those requirements as low as possible to set the focus on managing documents!\
\
But JumpingFile does not ignore the coprate usage of a document management system. When Jumpingfile is used in a coproation environemtn, the core component can be installed as server component to be accessed by all users.\

JumpingFile is in it's early stages! Stay tuned for more information as the project develops!
